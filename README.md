# Project - Restaurant


## What? 

We had 3 days to create a restaurant website.
The restaurant needed a webpage with a take-out ordering page.

## How ?

We started out by making a [mockup](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEPrup5J4w/BncNalsDaQT6Lottj7u0Jg/view#1).
Which helped us start off with the project.
To make sure tasks were correctly done and split between
team members, we decided to create a Trello.
 

## Following technologies were used 

* HTML
* CSS 
* Bootstrap 
* Javascript 

## Some improvement points

**Lay-out & design**
Regarding the lay-out and design of our webpage the only thing that
still needed some changes was the positioning of "opening hours".
We would've liked it better if it was positioned next to the "Google map".

**Functionality**
The navigation bar's "about" us and "contact" buttons aren't functional.
We would've liked it if by clicking on them the visitor would've gotten redirected 
to the bottom of the page.

**Responsiveness**
An overall responsiveness improvement is needed for the website.

**UX Design**
* To improve user experience, the Menu search bar should be place on the active page itself and not in the navigation bar.
* Improve "opening" & "closing" hours' overall UX Design.
